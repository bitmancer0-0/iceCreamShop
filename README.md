# iceCreamShop

An application that renders "ice cream" using TailwindCSS & JS, based on user inputs.

Roadmap:

Phase 1- Design each "ice cream" mini-components
    i. Chocolate
    ii. Vanilla
    iii. Strawberry
    iv. one scoop
    v. two scoops
    vi. three scoops
    vii. cone
    viii. bowl

Phase 2- Combine 'mini-components' into cohesive 'full components'
    ie: <div class="scoops-three choc-3 cone"></div> should render an ice cream cone with three chocolate scoops
    
Phase 3- Once a working variation of the above is implemented, set up programmatic logic to take & record
input.
    i. create customer class
    ii. create classes for ice cream; attach price values to each field to calculate total cost of a given order.
    iii. track customer instance object favorite flavors, total money spent, avg scoops purchased, cone or bowl preference
